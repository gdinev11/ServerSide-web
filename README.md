# TO-DO README

Idea:

Maintaining all of your vehicle repair needs

<br>

Motivation:
<br>
<br>
If one has ever owned a car or looking to own a car, they must understand the complexity of its repairs. Throughout the course of one’s life there will always be the need for maintenance on your vehicle. Sooner or later you will have to bring your car into a shop and get it fixed in order for you and others on the road to be safe. Thus, I will be developing a website that allows users to create profiles in order for auto repair businesses to recognize their clients, schedule appointments, and offer suggestions.
I personally have been working in a mechanic shop for 8 years now. Throughout the years people will always be calling several times but do not understand that us mechanics are working and cannot be around the phone to answer. This creates a dilemma because if the phones are not being picked up and people urgently need their vehicles fixed, then a lot of walk-ins occur. This causes immense frustration and stress due to the amount of work on hand that needs to be completed in a set time frame of the daily work schedule.

Application:
<br>
<br>
This website will be a fully functional page where users can create accounts in order to be able to schedule appointments to get their vehicles looked at. This site will allow users to adjust their profiles and set up all their information for their specific vehicle. People will be able to decide for themselves what times best fits their own schedule to fix the vehicle. Furthermore, the site will offer the resources of where to find parts and the estimates of said job. By picking out of time slots when they can bring their vehicle in for maintenance, inspection, or suggestions/offers, the business and its clients will be satisfied without stressful situations.
